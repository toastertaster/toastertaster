# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my public code respositories.

### About Me

- I ðŸ§¡ and ðŸ›  ðŸ›° with ðŸ”­ and ðŸ“¸. What a humbling experience and privilege to work on <img src="https://www.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/nasa-logo-web-rgb.png" width=20 height=20> programs.
- Have been programming for over 29 years.  A little bit of everything along the way, except Cobol.  I remember when AI wasn't cool!
- Earned a doctorate in electrical engineering, and still spend my nights and weekends learning new things!  Check out [my library](https://github.com/toastertaster/my-library) to see more.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning: SysML and discrete math fundamentals.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about: Signal processing, math, and safe use of algorithms.
- âš¡ Fun fact: My research specialization is using metaprogramming to solve signal processing problems in advanced optics flying in space.  But that's enough buzzwords for one day!
- âœ¨ I've led teams putting machine learning algorithms into production in complex systems for 10 years.  It has been a lot of fun teaching newcomers all of the exciting advances in software for AI in the last few years, including the role of engineers in safe use of algorithms.  
- Mentored [FIRST robotics](https://www.firstinspires.org/)  <img src="https://www.firstinspires.org/sites/default/files/uploads/resource_library/brand/thumbnails/FIRST-Icon.png" width=30 height=20> for 9 years, and am amazed by my former students every day.
